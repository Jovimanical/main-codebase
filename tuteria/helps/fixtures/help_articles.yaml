      \ earning goal</b><br>Think of how much you plan to earn in a month, then calculate\
      \ what that roughly translates to per hour and see if it reflects the value\
      \ of your work.</p><p>Here\u2019s a hypothetical example:</p><p>Let\u2019s assume\
      \ you wish to earn &#8358;30,000 at the end of the month. We\u2019ll also assume\
      \ you\u2019d prefer to teach at least twice a week, for say 2 hours per session.</p><p>That\
      \ means in one week, you\u2019ll teach 2 sessions x 2 hours = 4 hours. In one\
      \ month, you\u2019ll teach 4 hours x 4 weeks = 16 hours. So in this example,\
      \ you can set your hourly charge at &#8358;30,000/16 = &#8358;1,875/hr.</p><p>Similarly,\
      \ a &#8358;50,000 monthly goal translates to &#8358;3,125/hr, and &#8358;100,000\
      \ translates to &#8358;6,250/hr.</p><p>This is only a guide. When you factor\

      \ client's location so that they can pay everything at once. Tutors are not\
      \ allowed to request any form of direct payments from clients.</p><p><b>Consider\
      \ charging slightly less at the beginning</b><br>Even though majority of clients\
      \ consider competence and quality to be the most important factors, often times,\
      \ price will be the ultimate determinant for who they decide to hire.</p><p>We\

      \ trust and safety within our community.</p><p>Our application process manually\
      \ verifies tutors' identity offline and online including their education, work\
      \ and other personal details. Background checks therefore provide an additional\
      \ metric to consider when choosing a qualified local tutor.</p><p>We have partnered\

      \ client, Background Checking International will conduct a National Criminal\
      \ Database search on a tutor which will return results limited to the following:</p><ul><li>Residential\
      \ Address Verification</li><li>Felony and misdemeanor convictions within the\
      \ past seven (7) years</li><li>Sex crime convictions (misdemeanor or felony)\

      \ applicable law, felony convictions within the past seven years; and misdemeanors\
      \ within the past three years relating to children, theft, fraud or violence\

      \ This step is optional and may increase the chances of receiving future tutoring\
      \ lessons. Second, a client may order a background check on a tutor.</p><p><b>What\
      \ happens after a passed background check?</b></p><p>Upon notification of a\
      \ successful background check, Tuteria will post an icon on the tutor\u2019\
      s profile that indicates they have successfully passed the check. Clients will\
      \ be able to see this icon when choosing a tutor.</p><p><b>What happens after\
      \ a failed background check?</b></p><p>In compliance with the law, Tuteria will\
      \ deactivate the profile of any tutor who does not pass a background check.\
