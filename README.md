----------------------

<b>After cloning the repository, Ensure you checkout to the `master` branch and branch off from there e.g</b>

    $ git clone <source code repo>
    $ git checkout master
    $ git branch -b <Your reponame>

The steps below will get you up and running with a local development environment. We assume you have the following installed.:

* [PostgresSql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
* [Redis](http://redis.io/download) 


    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) installed on your System, then you just need to run the following commands

pip install -r tuteria/requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements/python3.txt

```
